# Data Exploration & Cleaning Project 🚀

Welcome to this exciting data exploration and cleaning project, guided by none other than Alext the Analyst! 📊✨

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the dynamic journey of understanding and refining datasets using SQL for comprehensive exploration and cleaning. The primary focus lies on two key domains: COVID-19 Data and Nashville Housing Data.

## Guided by Alext the Analyst 📈
Alext, your experienced guide in this data adventure, brings a wealth of knowledge in data analysis and exploration. Together, we'll leverage SQL to unravel insights and ensure our datasets are pristine for further analysis.

## Purpose of the Project 🎯

### 1. COVID-19 Data Exploration 🌐
- **SQL Exploration Techniques:**
  - Utilize SQL queries to navigate through the COVID-19 dataset.
  - Uncover trends, patterns, and correlations within the data.
  - Apply aggregate functions to extract summary statistics.

### 2. Nashville Housing Data Cleaning 🧹
- **SQL Cleaning Functions and Techniques:**
  - Address non-uniform data using `CASE` statements.
  - Standardize data formats with the `CONVERT`function.
  - Employ filtering conditions to remove outliers.
  - Populate data using self join.
  - Break out columns using SUBSTRING and PASENAME functions.
  - Remove duplicates and drop unused columns.
  - Implement the `ROW_NUMBER()` function for data ranking.
